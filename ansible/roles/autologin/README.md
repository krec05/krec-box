# AutoLogin

One of the reasons that Ubuntu are considered so secure is because they require passwords to install 
software or to configure the system. They also require passwords to login to the computer. If you 
want to bypass the login password, there is an Auto Login function you can set and use.

## Enabling AutoLogin from command line for gdm3

1. For gdm3 display manager thatâ€™s in use by default in GNOME Desktop, open up a terminal window 
   (press Ctrl+Alt+T in Ubuntu), and run command to edit the config file:

   ```
   sudo editor /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
   ```

   Replace editor with your system text editor, or use nano that works in most Linux.

2. When file opens in text editor, add following line (or un-comment the lines by removing # at the 
   beginning) under **\[daemon]** section (replace user "ji" to yours):

   ```
   AutomaticLoginEnable = true
   AutomaticLogin = YOUR_USERNAME
   ```

   Or, use the lines below instead that auto-login with delay:

   ```
   TimedLoginEnable = true
   TimedLogin = YOUR_USERNAME
   TimedLoginDelay = 10
   ```

   Finally, press Ctrl+S to save file, Ctrl+X to exit. The change will apply in next boot.
